Identity Fusion NG is an **Identity Security Cloud (ISC) connector** that consolidates account data from one or more managed sources, lets you **map** attributes into a single Fusion account schema, **define** derived and unique values (including Velocity-based computation), and optionally **match** new or changed accounts to existing identities so you can avoid duplicate identities without brittle exact-match correlation alone.

**When to use it**

- You need **consistent attributes** across messy or multi-source account data before correlation.
- You need **generated or normalized identifiers** (unique IDs, UUIDs, counters, formatted strings) that standard sources do not provide.
- You need **similarity-based matching** and optional **manual review** when authoritative correlation rules are not enough.

Identity Fusion NG addresses the complex challenge of identity and account data aggregation through a streamlined **map-define-match framework**. This concept represents the high-level operation of the connector, which can execute all three steps or just one, but always in this logical sequence:

### The Map, Define, Match Framework

**The Three Pillars**
Map your attributes from different sources and accounts to align with your identity schema. Define new attributes from the existing ones, like unique identifiers, normalised versions of the original attributes and other powerful transformations. Finally, match your new accounts with existing identities to avoid creating duplicates, using all the previously processed attributes with a series of comparison algorithms to pick and choose.

1. **Map (Consolidation)**
   Map your attributes from different sources and accounts to align with your identity schema. Strict correlation often fails when data is inconsistent. Creating, normalizing, and combining attributes from multiple sources is complex. The connector provides flexible merging strategies when multiple sources contribute to the same attribute (first found, list, concatenate, or source preference).
2. **Define (Unique identifiers / Computation)**
   Define new attributes from the existing ones, like unique identifiers, normalised versions of the original attributes and other powerful transformations. ISC has no built-in way to generate unique identifiers and handle value collision. The connector provides powerful attribute definition using Apache Velocity templates, unique ID generation with disambiguation counters, immutable UUID assignment, and computed attributes.
3. **Match (Matching / Correlation)**
   Match your new accounts with existing identities to avoid creating duplicates, using all the previously processed attributes with a series of comparison algorithms to pick and choose. The connector provides similarity-based match detection comparing the resulting mapped and defined Fusion accounts against your identity baseline. It offers optional manual review workflows and configurable merging of account attributes.

Map, Define, Match Framework

### Operation Modes

Identity Fusion NG features three distinct operation modes:

- **Authoritative accounts**
- **Records**
- **Orphan accounts**

**Deployment Architecture**
The connector can be used side by side with any sources except when the goal is matching authoritative accounts to avoid duplication, in which case it acts like an umbrella of any source it manages and replaces the identity profile with its own.

You can use the **map**, **define**, and **match** capabilities independently or together. For **matching**, the Identity Fusion NG source should be **authoritative** in most cases—so it can determine which incoming managed accounts create a new identity and which correlate to an existing one. For **mapping and defining only** (unique IDs, calculated or consolidated attributes), Fusion is rarely configured as authoritative; adding managed account sources is optional and depends on your Map requirements.

## Reference: configuration at a glance

Configuration is grouped into menus in the connector source in ISC. Each menu contains multiple sections with specific settings.

### Connection Settings

Authentication and connectivity to the ISC APIs.

| **Personal Access Token secret**    | Client secret from your PAT                    | Yes                              | Keep secure; rotate as needed                                                         |
| **API request retries**             | Maximum retry attempts for failed API requests | No (shown when retry is enabled) | Default: 20; also configurable from Advanced Settings                                 |
| **Requests per second**             | Maximum API requests per second (throttling)   | No (shown when queue is enabled) | Default: 8; also configurable from Advanced Settings                                  |

> **Note:** **API request retries** and **Requests per second** also appear in **Advanced Settings → Advanced Connection Settings**. They control the same underlying settings; Connection Settings provides quick access, while Advanced Settings groups them with related queue and retry options.

> **Tip:** Create a dedicated identity for Identity Fusion and generate a PAT for your source configuration.

### Source Settings

Controls which identities and sources are in scope and how processing is managed.

For an in-depth explanation of source types, aggregation rules, correlation modes, and account lifecycle, see the [Source configuration](docs/guides/source-configuration.md) guide.

| Section                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**              | Determines if identities are included in the processing scope and defines an optional identity filter query.                                                                                              |
| **Sources**            | Configures authoritative sources, source behavior, aggregation/correlation modes, plus dual account filters: `Accounts API filter` (server-side) and `Accounts JMESPath filter` (client-side, page-wise). |
| **Processing Control** | Manages history retention, empty account deletion, and behavior when unique identifiers are missing.                                                                                                      |

> **Note:** Managed machine accounts (`isMachine=true`) are not supported by Identity Fusion NG. The connector skips them during managed-account ingestion and logs warning messages with discarded counts.
>
> Filter references: [Accounts list API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/list-accounts), [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/).
>
> Source behavior note: for sources of type **Records**, **Include record accounts in Match** can be turned off to run Map/Define and unique registration without Match scoring. See the per-source options in [Source configuration](docs/guides/source-configuration.md).

> **Tip:** You can use mapping settings to predefine an attribute and redefine the same attribute using attribute definition. The mapped value is available to the definition expression.

> **Tip:** Concatenated attributes are displayed in alphabetical order and duplicate values are removed. They can sometimes be good candidates for matching.

> **Tip:** You can keep all values found for a given attribute and generate a multi-valued attribute. You can get a comma-separated list of them if the schema attribute in question is not multi-valued.

### Attribute Definition Settings

Controls how attributes are defined (Define step), including unique identifiers, UUIDs, counters, and Velocity-based computed attributes.

**Note:** When an account is **enabled**, all attributes (including unique) are force refreshed and recalculated (internal mechanism to reset unique attributes).

> **Tip:** If you want to change a unique attribute other than the account name or ID, you can disable the Fusion account and re-enable it. This is handy in situations where a surname change affects a username, etc.

> **Tip:** When dealing with multiple managed sources, generate your own Fusion account ID (`nativeIdentity`) and name, and ensure both are unique. Two Fusion accounts with the same name correlate to the same identity. In fact, any account evaluated for correlation is automatically correlated to an identity whose name (not username) matches. An identity name is defined by the name of the account that originated it. Only the last Fusion account returned from a list of Fusion accounts with the same ID is processed.

> **Tip:** Do not use a unique attribute or username that you may want to reset down the line as the Fusion account name. Use any other account attribute, and reserve your account name for an immutable unique attribute that is as human-friendly as possible.

> **Tip:** Use attribute normalizers (`$Normalize`) to align different formats across different sources.

> **Tip:** You can define extra attributes in your configuration and not include them in your schema. You can use them as ephemeral support attributes to create new ones. Remember that previously processed attributes are available to the next ones. All normal attributes are available to unique attributes, as these are the last ones to be processed. Don't use a unique attribute in your matching settings, as it won't be available on the managed account being processed at runtime.

> **Tip:** Remember that normal attributes are automatically refreshed when new data is found. You don't need to force global or individual attribute refresh unless there's a good reason, like troubleshooting, testing, or if the attribute definition is time-sensitive.

> **Note:** In Velocity context, managed account snapshots (`$accounts` and `$sources`) include each source account’s `**attributes**` plus `**_id**` (composite managed key `sourceId::nativeIdentity`), nested `**source**` (`id`, `name` — ISC source id and name on managed rows), nested `**schema**` (`id` = native identity, `name` = display name from ISC `name` / `nativeIdentity`), and `**IIQDisabled**` (IdentityIQ-style disabled flag where `true` means disabled). The same composite key is available as top-level `**$originAccount**` for the origin only — it is the row’s `**_id**` on managed snapshots. Identity-backed rows (when the origin is Identities) use `**source.name**` = `Identities` (no `source.id`) and the same `**schema**` shape for display name and id. `$accounts` is deterministic: sources follow configured order, accounts keep insertion order within each source, and non-configured sources are appended. `**$account**` is the origin snapshot (managed shape or identity-backed when the origin is `Identities`).

The combined score is a weighted blend of per-attribute similarities; each rule’s **minimum similarity** is also its weight (higher minimum = more influence). |
| **Automatically assign on exact match?** | Assign to the matched identity without review when every real rule scores 100 and none were skipped | No       | Skips manual review only for an **exact attribute match**: all configured rules evaluated at 100% similarity with **no** rules skipped for missing values.                                              |

| **Similarity threshold & weight [0-100]** | Per-rule similarity threshold and blend weight | Yes      | Values must meet this minimum for the rule to **pass**. The same value weights the rule in the **combined match score** (stricter rules count more). Use 0 only if you need minimal weight; it is treated as weight 1 in the blend.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Mandatory match**                       | Rule must pass for a potential match           | No       | When Yes: similarity must be ≥ this rule’s minimum or the candidate is rejected, regardless of combined score. Passing mandatory rules still contribute to the weighted combined score like other rules.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Skip match if missing**                 | Skip rule when one side is missing             | No       | Default: Yes. Skipped rules do not affect the combined score. Automatic assignment on exact match requires **no** skipped rules and every evaluated score at 100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

> **Tip:** Use Fusion reports to fine-tune your matching thresholds and algorithms.

> **Tip:** Remember that mandatory match configurations scoring below their threshold invalidate the match. Add them to the top of the list to avoid unnecessary overhead.

> **Note:** During managed-account analysis, Identity Fusion evaluates identity-backed candidates first. Match evaluations against newly discovered unmatched Fusion accounts are only executed when no identity-backed match is found. If such a match is detected, it is logged/reported as **deferred** and no ISC account is emitted for that path until a later aggregation correlates that Fusion account to an identity.

## Quick start

1. **Add the connector to ISC** — Upload the Identity Fusion NG connector (e.g. via SailPoint CLI or your organization's process).
2. **Create a source** — In Admin → Connections → Sources, create a new source using the Identity Fusion NG connector. Mark it **Authoritative** when you need Match (so Fusion decides which incoming accounts create new identities vs. correlate to existing ones). For Map & Define only, Fusion is rarely authoritative.
3. **Configure connection** — Set Identity Security Cloud API URL and Personal Access Token (ID and secret). Use **Review and Test** to verify connectivity.
4. **Configure the connector** — Depending on your goal:

- **Map & Define only:** Set [Source Settings](docs/guides/source-configuration.md) (identity scope and/or sources), [Attribute Mapping Settings](docs/guides/map.md) for the **Map** step, and [Attribute Definition Settings](docs/guides/define.md) for the **Define** step.
    - **Match:** Configure [sources and baseline](docs/guides/source-configuration.md), then [Attribute Matching Settings](docs/guides/match.md) (matching and review) for the **Match** step.

5. **Discover schema** — Run **Discover Schema** so ISC has the combined account schema.
6. **Identity profile and aggregation** — Create an identity profile and provisioning plan as required by ISC, then run entitlement and account aggregation.

For step-by-step instructions and UI details, see the [Map](docs/guides/map.md), [Define](docs/guides/define.md), and [Match](docs/guides/match.md) guides.

## Custom command: `custom:dryrun`

Use `custom:dryrun` to run a **non-persistent aggregation analysis**. It evaluates managed accounts with the same matching logic used for reports, but it does not execute the persistence/writeback phase used by `std:account:list`. The connector records match/deferred/non-match report data for this command using the operation name (`custom:dryrun`), so deferred and other totals align with aggregation even when the SDK reports `commandType` as account list. When **Owner is global reviewer?** is enabled, it also loads the fusion source owner’s identity if missing from cache (same as `std:account:list`), so Match/reviewer setup works even when the Fusion source has no accounts yet.

### Input options

`custom:dryrun` supports optional runtime controls in the command input:

- `includeExisting` (boolean): Emit **every** fusion account row produced by the connector’s fusion account listing (`forEachISCAccount`), regardless of origin (identity baseline, identity-correlated, uncorrelated, managed-grown, and so on). Detail rows include the **`existing-fusion`** category; **`baseline`** and **`identity-linked`** may also appear as descriptive tags when they apply. Synthetic deferred stubs (`orphan-deferred:…`) and fallback analyzed-managed rows are not fusion listing rows and are not tagged `existing-fusion`. In the summary, **`emitted.includeExisting`** matches **`totals.fusionAccountsExisting`** (the same fusion inventory count from fetch / in-memory totals).
- `includeNonMatched` (boolean): Emit rows categorized as NonMatched.
- `includeMatched` (boolean): Emit rows whose `matching.status` is `matched`.
- `includeExact` (boolean): Emit rows that have at least one **exact** match candidate: every real attribute rule scored 100 with none skipped (same predicate as **Automatically assign on exact match?**). You can use this without `includeMatched` to list only those rows.
- `includeDeferred` (boolean): Emit rows whose `matching.status` is `deferred`. Same-aggregation deferrals that are not yet linked on any fusion account’s `accounts` list in this run are still included via a synthetic stub row (key `orphan-deferred:<managedAccountId>`), matching aggregation-style deferred reporting.
- `includeReview` (boolean): Emit rows with `review.pending === true`.
- `includeDecisions` (boolean): Emit rows linked to processed fusion review decisions.
- `writeToDisk` (boolean): When `true`, **does not** stream per-account rows in the HTTP response (which avoids client “maximum response size” limits). Instead, the connector writes one **pretty-printed JSON document** to a file under the connector host’s working directory in a `reports` subfolder: `{ “rows”: [ ... ], “summary”: { ... } }`, where `summary` is the same `custom:dryrun:summary` object returned over HTTP. The file name is `./reports/custom-report-<host-label>-<timestamp>.json`, where `<timestamp>` is the run start time in UTC as an ISO-8601 string with `:` and `.` replaced by `-` (for example `2026-04-04T14-30-00-000Z`), and `<host-label>` is the **first DNS label** of the API host in the connector **`baseurl`** (for example `acme` from `https://acme.api.identitynow.com`), not the full FQDN—so tenant or environment names stay short in filenames. The HTTP response still ends with that summary object, which includes `writeToDisk: true` and `reportOutputPath` (absolute path on the host where the connector process runs). Defaults to `false`.

All `include*` options default to `false`. If none are enabled, no account rows are streamed (or written).
`summary` is always emitted by default and is not a runtime option.

### What it returns

- Unless `writeToDisk` is `true`, streams final ISC account rows (`key`, `attributes`, `disabled`) like account list output. With `writeToDisk`, those row objects are stored under the `rows` array in the report file (not over HTTP).
- Adds root-level `matchingStatus` (and related context) to every streamed row with:
    - `status`: `matched`, `deferred`, `non-matched`, `review-error`, or `not-analyzed`
    - `matchAttempts`: how many managed accounts had Match run for this row in this report
    - `matches`: candidate identities and per-attribute scores when available
- Adds root-level `sourceStatus` and `correlationStatus` (source provenance and linked account context: `accounts`, `missing-accounts`, `reviews`, `statuses`, etc.)
- Adds root-level `review` only for rows categorized as `review` or `decisions`:
    - `pending`: whether there is an active pending form instance linked to any account id in `attributes.accounts`
    - `forms`: pending form references (`formInstanceId`, `url`)
    - `reviewers`: resolved reviewer identities (`id`, `name`, `email`)
    - `candidates`: candidate identity details (`id`, `name`, `scores`, `attributes`)
- Adds root-level `reportCategories` to every streamed row, listing all matched output categories for that row.
- Sends a final summary object with `type: custom:dryrun:summary` containing: `options` (the `include*` / `writeToDisk` flags used for the run), `emitted` (per **emitted** row, how often each report category appeared—filtered by your `include*` flags, so e.g. `includeDeferred` can stay `0` while `totals.deferredMatches` is non-zero if you did not enable `includeDeferred`), `totals` (run-wide analysis: Fusion account counts from the loaded source, custom-report Match-attempt slice counts such as `matchAttempts`, `matches`, `deferredMatches`, `nonMatches`, etc.), diagnostics, optional report `stats`, and processing time.

### Typical use cases

- Tune Match thresholds and algorithms before production changes.
- Validate source ordering and account provenance (`originSource`) behavior.
- Inspect correlated vs non-correlated outcomes without persisting state changes.

## Standard account schema attributes

Every Identity Fusion NG account exposes the following built-in attributes. These are always present regardless of Attribute Mapping or Attribute Definition configuration.

| Attribute            | Type                 | Multi | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| **id**               | string               | No    | Unique account identifier (native identity)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **name**             | string               | No    | Account display name                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **history**          | string               | Yes   | Dated log entries tracking account lifecycle events                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **statuses**         | string (entitlement) | Yes   | Current status labels (e.g. `baseline`, `uncorrelated`, `orphan`, `activeReviews`). **Note:** Status entitlements are static and **not** requestable.                                                                                                                                                |
| **actions**          | string (entitlement) | Yes   | Assigned actions (e.g. `correlated`, `reviewer:<sourceId>`). **Note:** All Action entitlements are requestable. The `report` entitlement can be requested to generate a report of the potential aggregated results without actually aggregating the source.                                          |
| **accounts**         | string               | Yes   | Managed account keys (`sourceId::nativeIdentity`) of all contributing managed source accounts; legacy raw IDs are supported for backwards compatibility                                                                                                                                              |
| **missing-accounts** | string               | Yes   | Managed account keys (`sourceId::nativeIdentity`) of managed source accounts not yet correlated; legacy raw IDs are supported for backwards compatibility                                                                                                                                            |
| **reviews**          | string               | Yes   | URLs to pending fusion review forms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **sources**          | string               | No    | Comma-separated list of managed source names currently contributing to this account                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **mainAccount**      | string               | No    | Managed account ID evaluated first when present. If populated with a valid managed account ID, that managed account is evaluated first for mapping and definition context.                                                                                                                           |
| **originSource**     | string               | No    | Name of the source that originally created this account. Set once at creation and never modified. Equals the managed account source name when the account originates from a source account, or `Identities` when it originates from an identity. Useful for auditing and tracing account provenance. |
| **originAccount**    | string               | No    | Identity ID or managed account key (`sourceId::nativeIdentity`) that originally created this Fusion account. Set once at creation and never modified. Legacy raw account IDs are supported for backwards compatibility. Pairs with `**$account`\*\* in Velocity for the origin snapshot object.      |

> **Note:** In addition to these standard attributes, the discovered schema includes any attributes defined via **Attribute Mapping** and **Attribute Definition** settings.

> **Tip:** Do not include attributes you don't need in your schema, and do not remove internal attributes.

> **Tip:** You can use status entitlements in search to find identities in different situations, such as those included in a pending Fusion review, your Fusion reviewers, identities with uncorrelated managed accounts, baseline-only identities, NonMatched identities, identities with manual assignments, etc.

> **Tip:** Account name definition is ignored for baseline Fusion accounts to ensure the Fusion account is automatically correlated with the identity that originated it.

## Best practices and tips

- Order always matters. Sources are evaluated in the configured order, attribute mappings, attribute definitions, and matching settings. Everything.
- Account for your manager correlation when dealing with multiple managed sources. A Fusion account with managed accounts from two sources may have a manager on either source, both, or none. If you want to use source manager correlation, you must persist the original manager correlation value pair in your Fusion schema, but the manager will never change. It is best to use a correlation rule in combination with a transform to implement dynamic manager correlation.
- When no identity matching is needed, Identity Fusion can be set as a non-authoritative source to create unique and/or derived attributes. It's usual to have Fusion create unique identifiers associated with one or more authoritative sources. One can configure those sources and the desired attribute definition, and force managed source aggregation before processing, so identifiers are created right after managed sources are aggregated under the same schedule, all controlled by Fusion.
