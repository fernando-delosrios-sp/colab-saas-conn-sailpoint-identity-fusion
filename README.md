Identity Fusion NG is an **Identity Security Cloud (ISC) connector** that consolidates account data from one or more managed sources, lets you **map** attributes into a single Fusion account schema, **define** derived and unique values (including Velocity-based computation), and optionally **match** new or changed accounts to existing identities so you can avoid duplicate identities without brittle exact-match correlation alone.

**When to use it**

- You need **consistent attributes** across messy or multi-source account data before correlation.
- You need **generated or normalized identifiers** (unique IDs, UUIDs, counters, formatted strings) that standard sources do not provide.
- You need **similarity-based matching** and optional **manual review** when authoritative correlation rules are not enough.

Identity Fusion NG addresses the complex challenge of identity and account data aggregation through a streamlined **map-define-match framework**. This concept represents the high-level operation of the connector, which can execute all three steps or just one, but always in this logical sequence:

### The Map, Define, Match Framework

**The Three Pillars**
Map your attributes from different sources and accounts to align with your identity schema. Define new attributes from the existing ones, like unique identifiers, normalised versions of the original attributes and other powerful transformations. Finally, match your new accounts with existing identities to avoid creating duplicates, using all the previously processed attributes with a series of comparison algorithms to pick and choose.

1. **Map (Consolidation)**
   Map your attributes from different sources and accounts to align with your identity schema. Strict correlation often fails when data is inconsistent. Creating, normalizing, and combining attributes from multiple sources is complex. The connector provides flexible merging strategies when multiple sources contribute to the same attribute (first found, list, concatenate, or source preference).
2. **Define (Unique identifiers / Computation)**
   Define new attributes from the existing ones, like unique identifiers, normalised versions of the original attributes and other powerful transformations. ISC has no built-in way to generate unique identifiers and handle value collision. The connector provides powerful attribute definition using Apache Velocity templates, unique ID generation with disambiguation counters, immutable UUID assignment, and computed attributes.
3. **Match (Matching / Correlation)**
   Match your new accounts with existing identities to avoid creating duplicates, using all the previously processed attributes with a series of comparison algorithms to pick and choose. The connector provides similarity-based match detection comparing the resulting mapped and defined Fusion accounts against your identity baseline. It offers optional manual review workflows and configurable merging of account attributes.

Map, Define, Match Framework

### Operation Modes

Identity Fusion NG features three distinct operation modes:

- **Authoritative accounts**
- **Records**
- **Orphan accounts**

**Deployment Architecture**
The connector can be used side by side with any sources except when the goal is matching authoritative accounts to avoid duplication, in which case it acts like an umbrella of any source it manages and replaces the identity profile with its own.

You can use the **map**, **define**, and **match** capabilities independently or together. For **matching**, the Identity Fusion NG source should be **authoritative** in most cases—so it can determine which incoming managed accounts create a new identity and which correlate to an existing one. For **mapping and defining only** (unique IDs, calculated or consolidated attributes), Fusion is rarely configured as authoritative; adding managed account sources is optional and depends on your Map requirements.

> **Note:** **API request retries** and **Requests per second** also appear in **Advanced Settings → Advanced Connection Settings**. They control the same underlying settings; Connection Settings provides quick access, while Advanced Settings groups them with related queue and retry options.

> **Tip:** Create a dedicated identity for Identity Fusion and generate a PAT for your source configuration.

### Source Settings

Controls which identities and sources are in scope and how processing is managed.

For an in-depth explanation of source types, aggregation rules, correlation modes, and account lifecycle, see the [Source configuration](docs/guides/source-configuration.md) guide.

| Section                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope**              | Determines if identities are included in the processing scope and defines an optional identity filter query.                                                                                              |
| **Sources**            | Configures authoritative sources, source behavior, aggregation/correlation modes, plus dual account filters: `Accounts API filter` (server-side) and `Accounts JMESPath filter` (client-side, page-wise). |
| **Processing Control** | Manages history retention, empty account deletion, and behavior when unique identifiers are missing.                                                                                                      |

> **Note:** Managed machine accounts (`isMachine=true`) are not supported by Identity Fusion NG. The connector skips them during managed-account ingestion and logs warning messages with discarded counts.
>
> Filter references: [Accounts list API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/list-accounts), [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/).
>
> Source behavior note: for sources of type **Records**, **Include record accounts in Match** can be turned off to run Map/Define and unique registration without Match scoring. See the per-source options in [Source configuration](docs/guides/source-configuration.md).

> **Tip:** You can use mapping settings to predefine an attribute and redefine the same attribute using attribute definition. The mapped value is available to the definition expression.

> **Tip:** Concatenated attributes are displayed in alphabetical order and duplicate values are removed. They can sometimes be good candidates for matching.

> **Tip:** You can keep all values found for a given attribute and generate a multi-valued attribute. You can get a comma-separated list of them if the schema attribute in question is not multi-valued.

### Attribute Definition Settings

Controls how attributes are defined (Define step), including unique identifiers, UUIDs, counters, and Velocity-based computed attributes.

For **Unique** definitions: same context plus outputs from normal definitions that ran first; use `$counter` for an automatic number suffix on collision (auto-append is skipped when the expression contains Velocity directives like `#if`/`#set`/`#end` — include `$counter` explicitly in that case), `$UUID` for a fresh v4 random ID, or `$isUnique(value)` to test whether a candidate value is free before falling back to `$counter`.

**Note:** When an account is **enabled**, all attributes (including unique) are force refreshed and recalculated (internal mechanism to reset unique attributes).

> **Tip:** If you want to change a unique attribute other than the account name or ID, you can disable the Fusion account and re-enable it. This is handy in situations where a surname change affects a username, etc.

> **Tip:** When dealing with multiple managed sources, generate your own Fusion account ID (`nativeIdentity`) and name, and ensure both are unique. Two Fusion accounts with the same name correlate to the same identity. In fact, any account evaluated for correlation is automatically correlated to an identity whose name (not username) matches. An identity name is defined by the name of the account that originated it. Only the last Fusion account returned from a list of Fusion accounts with the same ID is processed.

> **Tip:** Do not use a unique attribute or username that you may want to reset down the line as the Fusion account name. Use any other account attribute, and reserve your account name for an immutable unique attribute that is as human-friendly as possible.

> **Tip:** Use attribute normalizers (`$Normalize`) to align different formats across different sources.

> **Tip:** `$Normalize.address(address, country?)` accepts an optional country code (`"US"`, `"GB"`, or `"UK"` alias; defaults to `"US"`) and normalizes a full state/region name to its ISO code (for example `"California"` → `"CA"`, `"Greater London"` → `"LND"`). Use `$AddressParse.getStateName(code, country)` and `$AddressParse.getStateCode(name, country)` for explicit US/UK lookups (case-insensitive; returns the empty string for unknown inputs). Supported countries: `US`, `GB`, `UK` (alias for GB). `$AddressParse.getCityState` / `getCityStateCode` are deprecated because city names alone can collide across states.

> **Tip:** You can define extra attributes in your configuration and not include them in your schema. You can use them as ephemeral support attributes to create new ones. Remember that previously processed attributes are available to the next ones. All normal attributes are available to unique attributes, as these are the last ones to be processed. Don't use a unique attribute in your matching settings, as it won't be available on the managed account being processed at runtime.

> **Tip:** Remember that normal attributes are automatically refreshed when new data is found. You don't need to force global or individual attribute refresh unless there's a good reason, like troubleshooting, testing, or if the attribute definition is time-sensitive.

> **Note:** In Velocity context, managed account snapshots (`$accounts` and `$sources`) include each source account’s `**attributes**` plus the nested `**source**` (`id`, `name` — ISC source id and name on managed rows), nested `**schema**` (`id` = native identity, `name` = display name from ISC `name` / `nativeIdentity`), and `**IIQDisabled**` (IdentityIQ-style disabled flag where `true` means disabled). The top-level `**$originAccount**` is the same composite key for the origin row only. Identity-backed rows (when the origin is Identities) use `**source.name**` = `Identities` (no `source.id`) and the same `**schema**` shape for display name and id. `$accounts` is deterministic: sources follow configured order, accounts keep insertion order within each source, and non-configured sources are appended. `$sources` is a Map keyed by source name — use `$sources.get('SourceName')` to access a source's snapshots. `**$account**` is the origin snapshot (managed shape or identity-backed when the origin is `Identities`); note that `$account` may differ from `$accounts[0]` when the `mainAccount` mapped attribute is set.

| **Manual review match score [0-100]** | Minimum weighted combined similarity (0-100) required for a potential match | Yes      | Matches meeting this threshold (and their mandatory rules) are flagged for review. Typical range: 70-90. |
| **Enable automatic assignment** | Automatically assign to the matched identity if the score meets the auto assignment threshold | No       | When enabled, manual review is bypassed if the best match's score is >= the Automatic assignment match score. |

| **Similarity threshold & weight [0-100]** | Per-rule similarity threshold and blend weight | Yes      | Values must meet this minimum for the rule to **pass**. The same value weights the rule in the **combined match score** (stricter rules count more). Use 0 only if you need minimal weight; it is treated as weight 1 in the blend.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Mandatory match**                       | Rule must pass for a potential match           | No       | When Yes: similarity must be ≥ this rule’s minimum or the candidate is rejected, regardless of combined score. Passing mandatory rules still contribute to the weighted combined score like other rules.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Skip match if missing**                 | Skip rule when one side is missing             | No       | Default: Yes. Skipped rules do not affect the combined score. Automatic assignment on exact match requires **no** skipped rules and every evaluated score at 100.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Skip match if threshold not met**       | Exclude rule from the combined score when below its minimum | No       | Default: No. When enabled, non-mandatory rules with similarity below the per-rule minimum are excluded from the weighted combined score. Mandatory rules are always evaluated regardless of this toggle.                                                                                                                                                                            |

> **Tip:** Use Fusion reports to fine-tune your matching thresholds and algorithms.

> **Tip:** Remember that mandatory match configurations scoring below their threshold invalidate the match. Add them to the top of the list to avoid unnecessary overhead.

> **Note:** During managed-account analysis, Identity Fusion evaluates identity-backed candidates first. Match evaluations against newly discovered unmatched Fusion accounts are only executed when no identity-backed match is found. If such a match is detected, it is logged/reported as **deferred** and no ISC account is emitted for that path until a later aggregation correlates that Fusion account to an identity.

## Quick start

1. **Add the connector to ISC** — Upload the Identity Fusion NG connector (e.g. via SailPoint CLI or your organization's process).
2. **Create a source** — In Admin → Connections → Sources, create a new source using the Identity Fusion NG connector. Mark it **Authoritative** when you need Match (so Fusion decides which incoming accounts create new identities vs. correlate to existing ones). For Map & Define only, Fusion is rarely authoritative.
3. **Configure connection** — Set Identity Security Cloud API URL and Personal Access Token (ID and secret). Use **Review and Test** to verify connectivity.
4. **Configure the connector** — Depending on your goal:

- **Map & Define only:** Set [Source Settings](docs/guides/source-configuration.md) (identity scope and/or sources), [Attribute Mapping Settings](docs/guides/map.md) for the **Map** step, and [Attribute Definition Settings](docs/guides/define.md) for the **Define** step.
    - **Match:** Configure [sources and baseline](docs/guides/source-configuration.md), then [Attribute Matching Settings](docs/guides/match.md) (matching and review) for the **Match** step.

5. **Discover schema** — Run **Discover Schema** so ISC has the combined account schema.
6. **Identity profile and aggregation** — Create an identity profile and provisioning plan as required by ISC, then run entitlement and account aggregation.

For step-by-step instructions and UI details, see the [Map](docs/guides/map.md), [Define](docs/guides/define.md), and [Match](docs/guides/match.md) guides.

## Custom command: `custom:dryrun`

Use `custom:dryrun` to run a **non-persistent aggregation analysis**. It evaluates managed accounts with the same matching logic used for reports, but it does not execute the persistence/writeback phase used by `std:account:list`. The connector records match/deferred/non-match report data for this command using the operation name (`custom:dryrun`), so deferred and other totals align with aggregation even when the SDK reports `commandType` as account list. When **Owner is global reviewer?** is enabled, it also loads the fusion source owner’s identity if missing from cache (same as `std:account:list`), so Match/reviewer setup works even when the Fusion source has no accounts yet.

### Input options

`custom:dryrun` supports optional runtime controls in the command input:

- `includeExisting` (boolean): Emit **every** fusion account row produced by the connector’s fusion account listing (`forEachISCAccount`), regardless of origin (identity baseline, identity-correlated, uncorrelated, managed-grown, and so on). Detail rows include the **`existing-fusion`** category; **`baseline`** and **`identity-linked`** may also appear as descriptive tags when they apply. Synthetic deferred stubs (`orphan-deferred:…`) and fallback analyzed-managed rows are not fusion listing rows and are not tagged `existing-fusion`. In the summary, **`emitted.includeExisting`** matches **`totals.fusionAccountsExisting`** (the same fusion inventory count from fetch / in-memory totals).
- `includeNonMatched` (boolean): Emit rows categorized as NonMatched.
- `includeMatched` (boolean): Emit rows whose `matching.status` is `matched`.
- `includeExact` (boolean): Emit rows that have at least one **exact** match candidate: every real attribute rule scored 100 with none skipped. You can use this without `includeMatched` to list only those rows.
- `includeDeferred` (boolean): Emit rows whose `matching.status` is `deferred`. Same-aggregation deferrals that are not yet linked on any fusion account’s `accounts` list in this run are still included via a synthetic stub row (key `orphan-deferred:<managedAccountId>`), matching aggregation-style deferred reporting.
- `includeReview` (boolean): Emit rows with `review.pending === true`.
- `includeDecisions` (boolean): Emit rows linked to processed fusion review decisions.
- `writeToDisk` (boolean): When `true`, **does not** stream per-account rows in the HTTP response (which avoids client “maximum response size” limits). Instead, the connector writes one **pretty-printed JSON document** to a file under the connector host’s working directory in a `reports` subfolder: `{ “rows”: [ ... ], “summary”: { ... } }`, where `summary` is the same `custom:dryrun:summary` object returned over HTTP. The file name is `./reports/dry-run-<host-label>-<timestamp>.json`, where `<timestamp>` is the run start time in UTC as an ISO-8601 string with `:` and `.` replaced by `-` (for example `2026-04-04T14-30-00-000Z`), and `<host-label>` is the **first DNS label** of the API host in the connector **`baseurl`** (for example `acme` from `https://acme.api.identitynow.com`), not the full FQDN—so tenant or environment names stay short in filenames. When `writeToDisk` is enabled, the connector also writes the HTML report to `./reports/dry-run-<host-label>-<timestamp>.html`. The HTTP response still ends with that summary object, which includes `writeToDisk: true`, `reportOutputPath`, and `reportHtmlOutputPath` (absolute paths on the host where the connector process runs). Defaults to `false`.

All `include*` options default to `false`. If none are enabled, no account rows are streamed (or written).
`summary` is always emitted by default and is not a runtime option.

### What it returns

- Unless `writeToDisk` is `true`, streams final ISC account rows (`key`, `attributes`, `disabled`) like account list output. With `writeToDisk`, those row objects are stored under the `rows` array in the report file (not over HTTP).
- Adds root-level `matchingStatus` (and related context) to every streamed row with:
    - `status`: `matched`, `deferred`, `non-matched`, `review-error`, or `not-analyzed`
    - `matchAttempts`: how many managed accounts had Match run for this row in this report
    - `matches`: candidate identities and per-attribute scores when available
- Adds root-level `sourceStatus` and `correlationStatus` (source provenance and linked account context: `accounts`, `missing-accounts`, `reviews`, `statuses`, etc.)
- Adds root-level `review` only for rows categorized as `review` or `decisions`:
    - `pending`: whether there is an active pending form instance linked to any account id in `attributes.accounts`
    - `forms`: pending form references (`formInstanceId`, `url`)
    - `reviewers`: resolved reviewer identities (`id`, `name`, `email`)
    - `candidates`: candidate identity details (`id`, `name`, `scores`, `attributes`)
- Adds root-level `reportCategories` to every streamed row, listing all matched output categories for that row.
- Sends a final summary object with `type: custom:dryrun:summary` containing: `options` (the `include*` / `writeToDisk` flags used for the run), `emitted` (per **emitted** row, how often each report category appeared—filtered by your `include*` flags, so e.g. `includeDeferred` can stay `0` while `totals.deferredMatches` is non-zero if you did not enable `includeDeferred`), `totals` (run-wide analysis: Fusion account counts from the loaded source, dry-run Match-attempt slice counts such as `matchAttempts`, `matches`, `deferredMatches`, `nonMatches`, etc.), diagnostics, optional report `stats`, and processing time.

### Typical use cases

- Tune Match thresholds and algorithms before production changes.
- Validate source ordering and account provenance (`originSource`) behavior.
- Inspect correlated vs non-correlated outcomes without persisting state changes.

## Standard account schema attributes

Every Identity Fusion NG account exposes the following built-in attributes. These are always present regardless of Attribute Mapping or Attribute Definition configuration.

| **originSource**     | string               | No    | Name of the source that originally created this account. Set once at creation and never modified. Equals the managed account source name when the account originates from a source account, or `Identities` when it originates from an identity. Useful for auditing and tracing account provenance. |
| **originAccount**    | string               | No    | Identity ID or managed account key (`sourceId::nativeIdentity`) that originally created this Fusion account. Set once at creation and never modified. Legacy raw account IDs are supported for backwards compatibility. Pairs with `**$account`\*\* in Velocity for the origin snapshot object.      |

> **Note:** In addition to these standard attributes, the discovered schema includes any attributes defined via **Attribute Mapping** and **Attribute Definition** settings.

> **Tip:** Do not include attributes you don't need in your schema, and do not remove internal attributes.

> **Tip:** You can use status entitlements in search to find identities in different situations, such as those included in a pending Fusion review, your Fusion reviewers, identities with uncorrelated managed accounts, baseline-only identities, NonMatched identities, identities with manual assignments, etc.

> **Tip:** Account name definition is ignored for baseline Fusion accounts to ensure the Fusion account is automatically correlated with the identity that originated it.

## Best practices and tips

- Order always matters. Sources are evaluated in the configured order, attribute mappings, attribute definitions, and matching settings. Everything.
- Account for your manager correlation when dealing with multiple managed sources. A Fusion account with managed accounts from two sources may have a manager on either source, both, or none. If you want to use source manager correlation, you must persist the original manager correlation value pair in your Fusion schema, but the manager will never change. It is best to use a correlation rule in combination with a transform to implement dynamic manager correlation.
- When no identity matching is needed, Identity Fusion can be set as a non-authoritative source to create unique and/or derived attributes. It's usual to have Fusion create unique identifiers associated with one or more authoritative sources. One can configure those sources and the desired attribute definition, and force managed source aggregation before processing, so identifiers are created right after managed sources are aggregated under the same schedule, all controlled by Fusion.

- (2026-06-24) Made `fusionAutoAssignmentScore` mandatory and enforced strict threshold validation against the manual review score.
- (2026-06-24) Consolidated Fusion account identity-name resolution: `IdentityInfo` now exposes distinct `id`, alias `name`, and human-readable `displayName` chains; `FusionAccount.name` resolves to the source title only; `fusionDisplayAttribute` and `fusionIdentityAttribute` are now immutable once set (with a UUID fallback for missing identity attributes); identity decisions use mapping/definition config for display resolution. The Fusion Review Decisions card now renders human-readable account names and links the "Created new identity" entry to the ISC account page.
- (2026-06-26) Added an optional **Skip match if threshold not met** toggle on Fusion attribute match rules. When enabled, non-mandatory rules whose computed similarity is below their configured minimum are excluded from the weighted combined match score, so weak signals no longer drag the combined score down. Mandatory rules are always evaluated regardless of this toggle. Documented in the matching guide and the README matching rules reference.
- (2026-06-26) Added a new **Binary (Exact Match)** algorithm to Fusion attribute match configuration. It returns a score of 100 only when the two values are identical strings (case- and whitespace-sensitive) and 0 otherwise, making threshold configuration trivial for stable identifiers (employee IDs, UUIDs, pre-normalized emails). Forgiving comparison can still be achieved by pre-normalizing values in **Define** before applying Binary.
- (2026-06-26) Refactored connector internals: added `SourceService` getters for delayed-aggregation and reverse-correlation sources, consolidated account-create identity-name resolution into a shared `resolveIdentityNameFromCreateInput` helper, aligned composite managed-account key handling (now normalized consistently via `getManagedAccountKeyFromAccount`), introduced `OperationContext` enum for `FusionService`, extracted batching into a dedicated module (`src/services/fusionService/batching.ts`), and added `isSet`/`isNotSet` aliases plus type-safe `Account.attributes` helpers and `FusionAccount` attribute accessors (`getAttribute`, `getStringAttribute`, `hasAttribute`).
- (2026-06-26) Added per-operation C4 container diagrams (`.drawio`) under `docs/operations/diagrams/` for `testConnection`, `accountList`, `accountRead`, `accountCreate`, `accountUpdate`, `accountEnable`, `accountDisable`, `entitlementList`, `accountDiscoverSchema`, and `custom:dryrun`.
- (2026-06-26) Clarified and tightened operation documentation (`account-read`, `account-create`, `account-enable`, `account-update`, `entitlement-list`) to reflect current setup, rebuild, cascade-aggregation, and output flows.

### 2.1.7 - 2026-06-22

- Fixed identity schema discovery bugs (undefined names, casing overwrites, type mapping, and error propagation).
- Renamed `tenant` mapped attribute reference to `mainAccount` in connector logic and documentation.
- Removed legacy `_id` fallback from Velocity Context account snapshots.
- Streamlined identity name assignment in FusionAccount and FusionService.
- Identity-origin accounts are now orphaned only when their origin identity is outside the configured identity scope.
- Identity-origin accounts now set the Fusion identity attribute to the source identity id.
- Consolidated UUID and incremental-counter generation as sub-modes of the Unique attribute type.
- Added `$isUnique(value)` helper for Unique Velocity expressions.
- Improved Velocity context for identity-backed accounts and `$sources` Map access.
- Updated connector-spec help text and `docs/guides/define.md` for the new Unique/UUID/counter behavior.
- Updated dependencies and npm `allowScripts` policy; added OpenSec support.
- Added AI-powered PR review workflows using Cursor and OpenCode agents.
- Refactored `getManagedAccountKeyFromAccount` to return `buildManagedAccountKey` directly.
- Fixed `maxLength` output transform ordering — now applied after trim/case/spaces/normalize, so final value is exactly ≤ `maxLength` instead of shorter due to post-truncation trimming.
- Added counter-aware `maxLength` truncation for Unique definitions: counter character width is reserved from the budget before prefix truncation, ensuring the assembled value (prefix + counter) does not exceed `maxLength`.

### 2.1.6 - 2026-04-29

- Improved performance by caching listSourceSchemas API results.

- Added PR CI review orchestration with refactor, documentation, and README changelog gates.
- Added deterministic PR quality checks for refactor review, code documentation review, and docs/changelog review.
