# account-discover-schema Spec

## Purpose

The account-discover-schema operation returns the account schema used by ISC. This spec defines the contract for schema discovery behavior.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Schema discovery returns account schema

The account-discover-schema operation SHALL fetch all configured sources and build a dynamic Fusion account schema from managed source schemas plus connector attribute mapping and definition configuration, then return that schema via `res.send`.

#### Scenario: Successful schema discovery

- **GIVEN** a valid connector configuration with managed sources and attribute definitions
- **WHEN** the account-discover-schema operation is invoked
- **THEN** the connector SHALL fetch all sources
- **AND** SHALL build the dynamic account schema via `buildDynamicSchema()`
- **AND** SHALL return the complete account schema with all attribute definitions

#### Scenario: Schema discovery with custom attributes

- **GIVEN** normal and unique attribute definitions configured in connector settings
- **WHEN** the account-discover-schema operation is invoked
- **THEN** the returned schema SHALL include attributes derived from those definitions

### Requirement: Discovered schema has no case-insensitive duplicate attribute names

The account-discover-schema operation MUST return a schema whose attribute list contains at most one entry per case-insensitive attribute name.

#### Scenario: Discover schema after merging identity and managed attributes

- **GIVEN** configured managed sources and identity attributes that define the same logical attributes with different casing (e.g. `FirstName` vs `firstname`)
- **WHEN** the account-discover-schema operation is invoked
- **THEN** the returned schema MUST NOT contain both `FirstName` and `firstname`
- **AND** the returned schema MUST contain exactly one attribute for each logical name

#### Scenario: Discover schema acceptable to ISC API

- **GIVEN** a connector deployment where schema discovery previously failed due to case-insensitive duplicate attribute names
- **WHEN** the account-discover-schema operation is invoked with the fixed connector
- **THEN** the returned schema MUST be valid for ISC schema registration (no case-insensitive name collisions)
