# identity-service Spec

## Purpose

The identity service (`src/services/identityService.ts`) is the connector's read-side adapter for SailPoint identities. It wraps the SailPoint API client's `AccountsApi` and `Search` resources and exposes identity-document operations used by correlation, change-detection, and the report operation. This spec defines the contract for how the connector searches, reads, and resolves identities on the upstream side.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Identity-origin Fusion accounts become orphan when origin identity leaves scope

A Fusion account created from an ISC identity MUST be considered orphan when it has no managed source accounts and its origin identity is not present in the configured identity scope.

Feature: Identity-origin orphan detection

#### Scenario: Identity-origin account with origin identity in scope and no managed accounts remains active
- **GIVEN** a Fusion account was created from identity `idn-1`
- **AND** `idn-1` is present in the configured identity scope
- **AND** the Fusion account has no managed source accounts
- **WHEN** the aggregation processes the account
- **THEN** the account is not marked `orphan`
- **AND** the account is emitted in the output

#### Scenario: Identity-origin account with origin identity removed from scope becomes orphan
- **GIVEN** a Fusion account was created from identity `idn-1`
- **AND** `idn-1` is not present in the configured identity scope
- **AND** the Fusion account has no managed source accounts
- **WHEN** the aggregation processes the account
- **THEN** the account is marked `orphan`
- **AND** the account retains the `baseline` status

#### Scenario: Identity-origin account with managed accounts is not orphan even when origin identity is out of scope
- **GIVEN** a Fusion account was created from identity `idn-1`
- **AND** `idn-1` is not present in the configured identity scope
- **AND** the Fusion account still has managed source accounts
- **WHEN** the aggregation processes the account
- **THEN** the account is not marked `orphan`

#### Scenario: Managed-origin account without managed accounts still becomes orphan
- **GIVEN** a Fusion account was created from a managed source account
- **AND** the account has no managed source accounts left
- **WHEN** the aggregation processes the account
- **THEN** the account is marked `orphan`

#### Scenario: Single-account read detects out-of-scope origin identity
- **GIVEN** a Fusion account was created from identity `idn-1`
- **AND** `idn-1` is not present in the configured identity scope
- **AND** the account has no managed source accounts
- **WHEN** an `accountRead` operation rebuilds the account
- **THEN** the account is marked `orphan`
- **AND** the returned ISC account includes the orphan status
- **AND** `deleteEmpty` does not suppress single-account read output (it applies only when aggregation emits accounts)

#### Scenario: deleteEmpty filters identity-origin orphans from aggregation output
- **GIVEN** a Fusion account was created from identity `idn-1`
- **AND** `idn-1` is not present in the configured identity scope
- **AND** the account has no managed source accounts
- **AND** `deleteEmpty` is enabled
- **WHEN** the aggregation emits accounts
- **THEN** the account is not sent to the platform

### Requirement: Identity Fetch SHALL ingest documents without blocking the event loop

When `includeIdentities` is enabled and an identity scope query runs, `IdentityService.fetchIdentities` SHALL register identity documents into FusionRun as search pages arrive (or in chunks of at most 250 documents when a collect-all array is the only available source). After each chunk or page, the service SHALL yield to the event loop (`yieldToEventLoop` / `setImmediate`) so Operation heartbeat and platform keep-alive timers can run. Protected identities SHALL continue to be excluded from the cache and from `identityIdsInScope`.

#### Scenario: Large identity search yields between ingest chunks

- **GIVEN** identity Fetch returns more than 250 in-scope identity documents
- **WHEN** `fetchIdentities` registers them on FusionRun
- **THEN** registration SHALL not run as a single uninterrupted synchronous loop over the full result
- **AND** the event loop SHALL be yielded at least once per 250 documents (or once per search page, whichever is smaller)

#### Scenario: Protected identities remain excluded

- **GIVEN** a search page contains a protected identity and an unprotected identity
- **WHEN** `fetchIdentities` ingests the page
- **THEN** only the unprotected identity SHALL be added to FusionRun
- **AND** only the unprotected identity SHALL be recorded in `identityIdsInScope`

### Requirement: Identity Fetch SHALL report ingested progress on the STATUS line

During identity bulk ingest, `IdentityService` SHALL update the Fetch `identities` population counter as in-scope documents are registered. When the ingest total is known and greater than zero, the service SHALL emit one DETAIL line with `action=ingesting identities` and `count=` before ingest work. Empty identity Fetch SHALL NOT set an `identities` counter. Identity Fetch SHALL NOT call `setProgress` with unit `ingested` as the Fetch pipeline slot.

#### Scenario: STATUS shows ingested progress during identity cache fill

- **GIVEN** identity Fetch is registering 1000 in-scope documents
- **AND** the operation heartbeat is active
- **WHEN** ingest is in progress
- **THEN** the `identities` Fetch population counter SHALL be updated
- **AND** a subsequent STATUS line SHALL include `identities=`
- **AND** the line SHALL NOT use `progress=` with unit `ingested` for that work

#### Scenario: Empty identity Fetch skips ingested progress

- **GIVEN** identity Fetch returns zero in-scope documents
- **WHEN** `fetchIdentities` completes
- **THEN** the service SHALL NOT set an `identities` Fetch population counter

#### Scenario: Skipped identity Fetch omits identities STATUS segment

- **GIVEN** identity Fetch is skipped for the run
- **WHEN** Fetch STATUS ticks fire
- **THEN** STATUS lines SHALL NOT include `identities=`
