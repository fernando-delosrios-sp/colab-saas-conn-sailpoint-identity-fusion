## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Operation heartbeat emits periodic STATUS lines

The log service SHALL provide an operation heartbeat that emits a `STATUS` text line at a configurable interval while an operation heartbeat is active. The interval SHALL be `statsLoggingIntervalMs` from Advanced Connection Settings (configured as `heartbeatInterval` in seconds in the connector UI; default 10 seconds). Each `STATUS` line SHALL include, when available: current phase, current step, pipeline progress (`done/total` with optional unit and delta since the previous tick), operation elapsed time, API queue statistics in compact form `api={active}a/{queued}q/{completed}c` with optional delta suffix, and process memory (RSS and heap used).

The `{queued}` value in the `api=` segment SHALL be the sum of `QueueStats.queueLength` and `QueueStats.rateLimitWaitCount` (treating absent `rateLimitWaitCount` as zero). This combined pending count SHALL represent all work not yet counted as active in-flight HTTP.

Pipeline progress and API queue completion are independent metrics. The pipeline progress delta SHALL reflect change in `OperationRunContext.progress.done`. The api-queue completed delta SHALL reflect change in `QueueStats.totalProcessed`. Both deltas SHALL use the format `(Δ±N/intervalSeconds)` where `intervalSeconds` is the configured heartbeat interval. The first STATUS tick after heartbeat start SHALL omit delta suffixes until a baseline exists from the prior tick.

When `OperationRunContext.progress.unit` is set, the STATUS line SHALL render the unit immediately after the fraction before the delta suffix (for example `progress=450/800 analyzed(Δ+120/10s)`).

When correlation PATCH activity has occurred in the run and the API queue has pending `IdentityService>correlateAccounts` items, STATUS lines during Output or Epilogue phase SHALL include a correlation drain segment with cumulative `completed=` and snapshot `pending=` counts alongside existing link/merge segments when non-zero.

#### Scenario: STATUS line during account-list Process phase

- **GIVEN** an account-list operation in Process phase with step `uncorrelated-sweep` and progress 537/800 analyzed
- **WHEN** the operation heartbeat interval fires
- **THEN** the connector host SHALL receive an INFO line prefixed with `[accountList] STATUS`
- **AND** the line SHALL include `phase=Process`, `step=uncorrelated-sweep`, and `progress=537/800 analyzed`

#### Scenario: STATUS includes pipeline progress delta during local work

- **GIVEN** pipeline progress was 7596/18495 at the previous STATUS tick and is now 10296/18495 during Refresh phase
- **AND** the API queue completed count remains unchanged
- **WHEN** the next STATUS line is emitted
- **THEN** the line SHALL include `progress=10296/18495` with a delta of `+2700` over the heartbeat interval
- **AND** the api segment SHALL show zero completed delta

#### Scenario: STATUS includes api-queue completed delta

- **GIVEN** the API queue completed count was 537 at the previous STATUS tick and is now 612 with 2 active and 5 queued
- **WHEN** the next STATUS line is emitted
- **THEN** the line SHALL include `api=2a/5q/612c` with a delta indicating `+75` completions since the previous tick

#### Scenario: STATUS api-queue segment uses completed not processed

- **GIVEN** a STATUS line includes API queue statistics
- **WHEN** an operator reads the line
- **THEN** the queue segment SHALL use compact form `api=Na/Nq/Nc`
- **AND** the completion counter SHALL be the third segment suffixed with `c` (not labeled `processed=`)

#### Scenario: STATUS q includes rate-limiter wait when FIFO is empty

- **GIVEN** the FIFO queue length is 0
- **AND** 49 dequeued items are awaiting rate-limit slots (`rateLimitWaitCount` is 49)
- **AND** 0 requests are active in-flight
- **WHEN** the next STATUS line is emitted
- **THEN** the line SHALL include `api=0a/49q/` in the api segment
- **AND** the completed counter delta MAY still increase on subsequent ticks as those items complete HTTP

#### Scenario: Default 10 second heartbeat interval

- **GIVEN** a source configuration with default Advanced Connection Settings
- **WHEN** a persistent account-list aggregation runs for more than 10 seconds
- **THEN** at least one STATUS heartbeat line SHALL appear within the first 10 seconds

#### Scenario: STATUS during Output shows correlation drain while queue pending

- **GIVEN** an account-list operation in Output or Epilogue phase with 2000 link PATCHes enqueued and 147 completed
- **AND** 1853 correlation PATCH jobs remain pending in the API queue
- **WHEN** the next STATUS heartbeat fires
- **THEN** the STATUS line SHALL include `completed=147` and `pending=1853` in the correlation segment
