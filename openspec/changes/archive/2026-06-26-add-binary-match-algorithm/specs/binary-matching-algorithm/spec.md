## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Binary algorithm produces a 100 score only for identical string values
The system SHALL, when the configured matching algorithm is `binary`, compute a score of 100 if and only if the account value and the candidate identity value are identical strings. All other comparisons SHALL produce a score of 0.

#### Scenario: Exact string match
- **WHEN** the account value is `"abc123"` and the candidate identity value is `"abc123"` and the rule algorithm is `binary`
- **THEN** the score is 100 and `isMatch` is true when the threshold is 100

#### Scenario: Different string values
- **WHEN** the account value is `"abc123"` and the candidate identity value is `"xyz789"` and the rule algorithm is `binary`
- **THEN** the score is 0 and `isMatch` is false

#### Scenario: Case-sensitive comparison
- **WHEN** the account value is `"ABC123"` and the candidate identity value is `"abc123"` and the rule algorithm is `binary`
- **THEN** the score is 0 and `isMatch` is false

#### Scenario: Whitespace-sensitive comparison
- **WHEN** the account value is `"abc123"` and the candidate identity value is `" abc123 "` and the rule algorithm is `binary`
- **THEN** the score is 0 and `isMatch` is false

### Requirement: Binary algorithm handles missing values as a non-match
The system SHALL produce a score of 0 for the `binary` algorithm when either the account value or the candidate identity value is missing, empty, or whitespace-only. Existing skip-on-missing configuration SHALL continue to apply unchanged.

#### Scenario: Account value is missing
- **WHEN** the account value is missing and the candidate identity value is `"abc123"` and the rule algorithm is `binary`
- **THEN** the score is 0 and the rule is skipped if `skipMatchIfMissing` is true

#### Scenario: Both values are missing
- **WHEN** both the account value and the candidate identity value are missing and the rule algorithm is `binary`
- **THEN** the score is 0 and the rule is skipped if `skipMatchIfMissing` is true

### Requirement: Binary algorithm is selectable in matching configuration
The system SHALL accept `binary` as a valid value for `MatchingConfig.algorithm` and expose it as a selectable option in `connector-spec.json`.

#### Scenario: Configuring a binary rule
- **WHEN** an administrator creates a matching rule with `algorithm: "binary"` and `fusionScore: 100`
- **THEN** the configuration is valid and the rule is evaluated using the binary exact-match scorer

### Requirement: Binary algorithm is labeled in forms and messages
The system SHALL display the friendly label "Binary (Exact Match)" wherever algorithm names are rendered in review forms and messaging helpers.

#### Scenario: Review form renders algorithm name
- **WHEN** a review form includes a score row produced by the `binary` algorithm
- **THEN** the rendered algorithm label is "Binary (Exact Match)"
